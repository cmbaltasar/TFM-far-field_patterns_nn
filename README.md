# TFM-far-field_patterns_nn
This repository supports a masterâ€™s thesis exploring neural networks to find radiating source setups (dipoles or antenna arrays) that reproduce specific far-field patterns. The goal is to train a model that estimates source distribution, reversing traditional antenna design for applications in electromagnetics, communications, and radar.
